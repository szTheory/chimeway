# Chimeway

## What This Is

Chimeway is an open-source, embedded notification layer for Elixir and Phoenix applications. It provides durable notification records, delivery orchestration, and explainable traces from trigger through policy, scheduling, batching, and provider attempts. It is local-first by design: host applications keep their own data, policies, and operational controls.

## Core Value

Every notification decision is explainable, so teams can reliably answer why a notification sent, failed, was deferred, or was suppressed.

## Current State

Chimeway shipped `v1.3 Workflow Journeys` on 2026-04-30. Milestone `v1.4 Channel Feedback Loops` reached its final phase on 2026-05-02: Phase 33 (Webhook Ingress Durability) shipped a durable atomic `Multi+Oban` handoff, and Phase 34 (Feedback Contract E2E Proof) closed the milestone audit by aligning the canonical `chimeway.delivery.{succeeded,bounced,failed}` vocabulary across production code and test fixtures, shipping a host-mounted E2E test that exercises the full webhook → ingress → worker → signal → workflow-progression → operator-trace path on real Oban queues, and authoring `34-VERIFICATION.md` that maps FLOW-01 / FLOW-02 to Phase 31 + Phase 32 + Phase 34 evidence with the Three-Axis Vocabulary Contract documented.

## Current Milestone: v1.4 Channel Feedback Loops

**Goal:** Extend Chimeway from a single outbound channel (email) to a first-class multi-channel substrate (SMS, push, chat) with inbound provider feedback that can drive workflow progression.

**Target features:**
- Generic outbound channel adapters (SMS, Push, Chat) without vendor coupling.
- Channel-specific render contracts (e.g. `text_body` for SMS vs `html_body` for email).
- Webhook ingestion + canonical normalization of provider callbacks (delivered/bounced/failed).
- Feedback-driven workflow progression (escalate on bounce, stop on delivered).
- Operator traces that connect inbound webhook events back to the journey step they triggered.

## Product Arc

- `v1.3 Workflow Journeys` — durable, explainable multi-step workflows and escalations.
- `v1.4 Channel Feedback Loops` — first-class outbound channels plus receipts/webhooks that can feed workflow progression.
- `v1.5 Adoption Surface` — reference flows, integration polish, and operator UX that make the library easier to adopt in production.

## Next Milestone Goals

- Make time-based and outcome-based workflow progression the next major product-value jump.
- Keep read/unread-driven branching and broad channel expansion deferred until the core journey model is stable.
- Preserve the local-first, explainable lifecycle model while extending beyond single-notification orchestration.

## Out of Scope

- Hosted, multi-tenant notification SaaS or open-core billing model — Chimeway is embedded OSS infrastructure.
- Reimplementing channel/provider foundations such as Swoosh or Oban — Chimeway integrates with them.
- Marketing automation, campaigns, or customer-engagement journey tooling — Chimeway is transactional/product notification focused.
- Hard-coding one SMS/push vendor — adapter seams remain replaceable.
- Broad channel-matrix expansion before orchestration behavior is mature — timing, batching, and recovery are the higher-leverage gaps for current adopters.

## Context

This project is being initialized from a detailed idea brief and prior-art synthesis focused on an ecosystem gap in Elixir/Phoenix notifications. Existing channel primitives are strong, but teams repeatedly rebuild routing, fanout, preferences, idempotency, read/seen state, retries, digests, and operator diagnostics. Chimeway targets that gap with an idiomatic, explicit, inspectable model that avoids opaque framework magic.

Prior context includes:
- Product and brand positioning emphasizing local-first ownership and explainable delivery.
- Domain research mapping lessons from Noticed (Rails), Laravel Notifications, Symfony Notifier, and Elixir channel libraries.
- Engineering DNA from sibling OSS libraries: strict CI, verification entrypoints, contract tests, and release hygiene.
- Operator IA intent centered on timeline tracing, redaction, and support-friendly debugging.
- Host-app integration seam guidance for auth, tenancy, URL generation, and correlation IDs.
- The shipped v1.0 milestone established the durable spine, policy checkpoints, telemetry correlation, safe adapter resolution, and transactional Oban dispatch as the baseline to build from.
- The shipped v1.1 milestone established production-trust behavior across preferences, reliability, observability, and integration documentation.
- Current milestone research reinforces that the next value jump is workflow behavior: time/outcome-based progression, escalation semantics, and journey-level explainability before broader channel breadth.

## Constraints

- **Tech Stack**: Elixir/Phoenix/Ecto-first with Oban and Swoosh integration seams — align with existing ecosystem strengths.
- **Architecture**: Stable notification keys (for example, `comment.created`) must be persisted as durable identity — avoid module-name coupling in data.
- **Data Ownership**: Host app database is source of truth for events, inbox state, deliveries, attempts, deferrals, and digest batches — no hosted control plane.
- **Composability**: Channel/provider integrations must use replaceable adapter behaviours — avoid hard vendor lock-in.
- **Operability**: Redacted, queryable traces must exist for support and debugging — explainability is core value, not optional polish.
- **Quality Bar**: Named `mix verify.*` and `mix ci.*` workflows, compile warnings as errors, and documented release checks are mandatory.
- **Scope**: v1.3 should prioritize workflow journeys and escalation semantics over broad channel expansion.
- **Scope**: The next milestone should stay centered on time/outcome progression before read/unread-driven branching or UI productization.
- **Compatibility**: Version baseline should track active Phoenix/Elixir LTS norms in sibling repositories.

## Key Decisions

| Decision | Rationale | Outcome |
|----------|-----------|---------|
| Persist stable notification keys as data identity | Survives module renames and preserves historical traceability | Implemented in Phase 01 notifier contract + persistence flow |
| Local-first embedded architecture | Host apps need ownership, auditability, and composability without SaaS dependency | Implemented (Phases 01-03) |
| Keep core explicit and inspectable | Elixir users expect clear behaviours and low magic | Implemented in Phase 01 trigger and inbox APIs |
| Treat explainability as product surface | "Why wasn't this sent?" is the primary operator differentiator | Implemented via durable traces and Phase 08 outcome surfacing |
| Integrate channel/job primitives instead of replacing them | Swoosh/Oban already solve core delivery substrates well | Implemented in Phase 02 (Swoosh/Adapter) and Phase 03/12 (Oban) |
| Start with durable spine + one channel slice | Fastest path to validate end-to-end architecture and DX | Durable spine completed in Phase 01 |
| Enforce OSS release hygiene as executable contracts | Maintainers need deterministic, repeatable release confidence | Implemented in Phase 05 docs/test/release hardening |
| Transactional Oban Dispatch | Prevent orphaned pending deliveries on transaction failure | Implemented in Phase 12 |
| String-safe adapter lookup | Prevent atom table exhaustion from runtime channel strings | Implemented in Phase 11 |
| Persisted policy controls | Keep suppression explicit, explainable, and durable across planning and perform gates | Implemented in Phase 13 |
| Durable attempt history and convergence | Make retries and final outcomes inspectable under concurrency and failure | Implemented in Phase 14 |
| Tenancy-aware trace queries | Preserve host ownership boundaries in observability surfaces | Implemented in Phase 15 |
| Integration docs as product surface | Lower host-app adoption risk with explicit setup and adapter guidance | Implemented in Phase 16 |
| Prioritize orchestration before channel breadth in v1.2 | Scheduling, batching, rendering, and recovery create larger product value than adding more providers now | Shipped in v1.2 |
| Keep canonical lifecycle identity through orchestration features | Deferred, digested, recovered, and emitted flows should stay explainable on durable rows | Implemented across phases 17-23 |
| Persist orchestration and rendering declarations as durable data | Replay, recovery, and preview should not depend on notifier module re-entry | Implemented across phases 21-23 |
| Prioritize workflow journeys before channel breadth in v1.3 | Multi-step SaaS notification behavior is the next major adoption gap after single-notification orchestration | Active milestone direction |
